description: >
  You can use wands to cast spells. A wand holds a specific wizard spell or (rarely) a cantrip,
  and attuning to the wand allows you to cast that spell or cantrip as though it were prepared/known.
  You have less difficulty attuning to multiple wands. A attunement slot can be used to attune to
  up to three separate wands. You can change what wands you are attuned to whenever you change your
  prepared spells without needing to use the Attunement ritual.
