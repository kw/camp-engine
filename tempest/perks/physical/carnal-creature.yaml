description: >
  The character has little desire to give up her body, and can remain dead for a
  Slow 300 before discorporating, rather than the normal 180. Any time after 180,
  she can let go and discorporate. This can be guided by player knowledge of what
  is occurring, as her Spirit gets some sort of sense of her surroundings after the
  initial Slow 180.
