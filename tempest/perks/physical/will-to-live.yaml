description: >
  Keeping a white-knuckle grip on life, the character can, once per Event, take ten points of Final
  damage instead of taking a Death Effect. For example, Tristan is struck with a spell-ball and the
  attacking creature Calls “Death by Hatred”. Instead of dying immediately, Tristan uses this Perk and
  takes ten points of Final damage. This blows through his summoned armor and his Life Points, causing
  him to be dying, but he is not dead yet.
