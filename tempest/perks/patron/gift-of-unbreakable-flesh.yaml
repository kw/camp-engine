description: >
  The character is beloved by a deity or greater supernatural power of some kind,
  who grants a number of points of Natural Armor (armor that need not have a prop and
  can be both Mended and Healed). The cost of this Perk is dependent on the number of
  Armor Points the character has been granted. If this Perk is upgraded after character
  creation, only the difference between the old level and the new level needs to be paid.
  (i.e. 3 points to get 2 points of armor, if the character already paid 2 Character Points
  to get 1 point of armor).

  **Note**: This armor works just like created armor in that choosing armor from another source
  will immediately exhaust these points.

  | Armor Points | Cost |
  | :----------: | :--: |
  | 1            | 2    |
  | 2            | 5    |
  | 3            | 10   |
  | 4            | 15   |
