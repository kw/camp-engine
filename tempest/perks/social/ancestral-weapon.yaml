name: Ancestral Weapon
cost: 4
requires: ancestral-relic
description: >
  The item that the character has chosen as her Ancestral Relic is a weapon that is
  bonded to the soul of the character. The arm holding the item is immune to Disable
  (“No Effect” should be called) and the weapon cannot be physically taken from the
  character, even if the character is unconscious or dead. The character can treat the
  item as if she had the Cold Dead Hands Perk. A Shatter Effect will destroy the Ancestral
  Weapon as per normal, and immediately drop the character to 0 Life Points and dying, but
  the weapon will reappear and reform in the character’s hand during the next Long Rest.
  Similarly, if lost, the weapon will return at the next Long Rest.
