description: >
  The character has a minor title such as Lord/Lady/Liege or Sir/Dame/Soren. This title has certain benefits and
  rights that come with it, but most only apply while the character is in their own demesne. The character does
  have the right to be called by her title and crimes against the character will be taken more seriously.
  Additionally, she will often be believed by local authorities or soldiers. This reduces the cost of the
  Income, Manse, Connections, and Famous Perks by 1.
