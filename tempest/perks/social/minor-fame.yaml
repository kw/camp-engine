name: Minor Fame

description: >
  The character is noted for some small deed or act of heroism (or infamy) in their past.
  While speaking to another character or NPC, the character may say “So it has been told” and
  give the reason that they might be well-known to the other.

  The character must choose one story in their approved background history to use with this Perk;
  it cannot be used to implant false knowledge or an adjusted tale (although, with Staff approval,
  the original story itself need not be true).

  **For Example**: _Adrian the Bard is speaking to Lord Cassowary, and Adrian says “So it has been
  told that I am the one who stopped the great Champion of the Dark Nasarack with a poisoned glass
  of wine” and Lord Cassowary would remember the tale._
