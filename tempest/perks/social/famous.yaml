name: Famous
cost: 3
requires: minor-fame
description: >
  In their life, the character has become famous for some reason. This might be one very
  significant event, a series of small but related events, or even just due to their position in life.
  This reason should be a part of the character’s backstory, and should be Staff-approved. The character
  may, at-will, use “So it has been told” (one of the Power Phrases detailed in the Getting Started Chapter)
  to inform others (including PCs) that they have heard of her reason for fame. Note that “So it has been told”
  does not require others to have heard the tale, but does suggest that it is likely. The reactions to the
  knowledge of the character’s fame are up to the portrayer.
