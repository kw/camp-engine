description: >
  The character has proficiency with great weapons (48”-90”).
  When a character uses a great weapon to perform a Spike,
  the wielder may choose to either do 1 additional point of
  base damage, or use the “Shield-Breaking” Effect.
  Remember to use any powers or deal damage, it must be held
  in both hands; the great weapon can still be used to block in
  a single hand. If the character is strengthened they can perform
  Spikes and use powers without holding the great weapon in both hands.
