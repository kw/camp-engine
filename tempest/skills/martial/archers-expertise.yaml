  When using the weapon with which the character has Weapon Specialization,
  the character, if she misses with a projectile while using a Power, can immediately
  (before making any other attacks or using other Powers) retry the same Power with a
  second shot without expending additional uses. The second attempt need not have the same target.
  If the retry misses, the Power is expended.
