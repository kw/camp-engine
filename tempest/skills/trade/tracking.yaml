description: >
  A character with the Tracking skill can follow a trail.
  Tracking trails will be marked with green flags marked
  with a white circle (called a “Halo”), and these flags must
  be ignored by anyone without tracking, just as all players
  ignore anything marked with the Halo sigil. If there is a card
  attached to a green flag with a Halo (a tracking flag), or if
  there is information on the back of the flag, a Tracker can
  read that information, which will usually give clues about the
  creatures leaving the tracks.
