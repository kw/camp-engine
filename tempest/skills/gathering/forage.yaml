description: >
  The character can forage Bloom and Night Prizes from the wilderness.
  These items are scattered around the wilderness. They will be hidden in bushes,
  trees or sticking out of the ground. Night Prizes will often be slightly more difficult
  to find, hiding on the backsides of rocks, under logs, or in caverns. Anyone can see
  bundles of Forage, but only those with the Forage skill can collect it (or do anything with it).
  In order to collect it, you must use a bladed tool and roleplay for a Quick 100, slowly collecting
  up the bundle of Bloom or Night Prizes. The character can Forage up to 10 Bloom and 5 Night Prizes
  per Long Rest.
