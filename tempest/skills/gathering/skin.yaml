ranks: 3
description: >
  The character can skin animals for Hide, or can collect Harvest from monsters with this skill.
  Rarely, powerful monsters may drop raw Scales that need to be cured before they can be used.
  A character with this skill can use a knife or other sharp tool (not a sword or any weapon of
  Hand size or larger) to roleplay skinning and harvesting parts from the monster or animal for a
  Quick 100 and will let the monster or animal portrayer know they are using Skin. The NPC will
  turn over all Hide, Harvest, and Scale that the player can take. Some creatures may only be
  skinned by skinners of rank 2 or 3, creatures that produce Scale will only be skinnable for rank
  3 skinners for example.

  Occasionally, especially while gathering Harvest, some side effects can occur. The skinner may be
  burned by acidic blood, or catch a disease, or be poisoned by exploding stomach gasses. The portrayer
  of the creature with the Hide or Harvest will call the negative effects.
