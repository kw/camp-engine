description: >
  The character can turn in treasure and resources to Staff overnight, or between games,
  and sell or trade them. Basic Resources will return 1 Wealth each. Crafted items will
  return either half the value of the components, or 1 Wealth for Apprentice-level recipes,
  2 for Journeyman-level recipes, or 3 for Master-level recipes, whichever is higher.
  Recipes that produce multiple doses will be marked down appropriately for the number of
  doses being Fenced, and values of less than 1 Wealth will be rounded down to zero.
  Items with a duration will be discounted based on the remaining duration. Items that do
  not fall under the Crafting system will have their return determined by Staff.
