requires:
  any:
    - basic-arcane
    - basic-faith
description: >
  The character can cast Novice level spells directly from her spellbook.
  Although the spell will still exhaust a Novice Magic Spell-Slot, it need not
  be Prepared (although it must be a spell the caster could Prepare).
  To bookcast a spell, the character must be out of combat, then character must
  either read the full incant five times from her spell-book, or must study her
  spellbook for a full minute before reading the incantation directly from the book.
  All other requirements and components will remain the same.
