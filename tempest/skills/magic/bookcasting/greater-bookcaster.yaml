name: Greater Bookcaster
cost: 3
# TODO(#15): Add "one greater spell-slot" requirement... if the skill actually develops one.
requires:
  - adept-bookcaster
description: >
  The character can cast Greater spells directly from her spellbook.
  Although the spell will still exhaust a Greater Spell-Slot, it need not
  be Prepared (although it must be a spell the caster could Prepare).
  To bookcast a spell, the character must be out of combat, then character
  must either read the full incant five times from her spell-book, or must study
  her spellbook for a full minute before reading the incantation directly from the book.
  All other requirements and components will remain the same.
