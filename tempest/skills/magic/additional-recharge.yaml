description: >
  The character is adept at tapping into her power source.
  Once per Long Rest she can perform a small personal centering ceremony
  (the details of which are up to the caster) which should take about five minutes.
  At the end of this ceremony she can refresh four Novice spell-slots from any one
  Sphere (although they do not have to be from the same class). These Novice spell-slots
  can be traded in for higher tier slots (two for Adept, three for Greater, and four for Master).
