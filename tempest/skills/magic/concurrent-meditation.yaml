# TODO(#15): The skill's actual requirements are based on spell slots, fix this when we're tracking them.
requires:
  - arcane
  - divine
description: >
  The character has learned how to pair the meditative cycles of arcane re-attunement and
  the prayers of divine refreshment. When the character would use a Short Rest power that
  refreshes her spell slots (ex: Arcane Study, Refreshing Prayer, etc.) she may refresh
  both Arcane and Divine spell slots with the same Short Rest.
