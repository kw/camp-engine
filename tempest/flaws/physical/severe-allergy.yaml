name: Severe Allergy
award:
  $Uncommon Allergens: 2
  $Common Allergens: 3
description: >
  The character has a supernatural allergy to gold, silver, iron, magic, or other substances which must
  be approved by Staff. Each time the character goes from not touching an object made of the material to
  touching it with skin, it will cause Piercing 1 by Agony (even cloth will prevent this damage). So a
  character with a gold ring would take the damage each time it was put on, as well as each time she touched
  a gold coin (even if the ring remained on).

  While in contact with the substance, even through cloth, the character cannot benefit from a Short or Long
  Rest or Healing and will have the drained Condition. The character will feel severely ill, feel burning pain,
  or have severe migraines and difficulty thinking (or any combination of these) while touching the material in
  question and should role play it as such. Cloth will not stop these symptoms but leather or thicker substances
  will. Weapons that are not obviously made of some other material are considered to be iron, and attacks from
  are considered to be “hitting skin” if they damage Life Points.

  3 points are awarded for materials that are likely to be very common such as leather, iron, and materia.
  2 points are awarded for materials that are less likely to be common or a hindrance, such as gold, silver, or
  any of the Resources. No points will be awarded for materials that are unlikely to be encountered, or will rarely
  cause a hindrance such as butter, horse hair, or werewolf skin.
