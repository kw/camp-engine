description: >
  The character has a supernatural allergy to gold, silver, iron, magic, or other substances which must be
  approved by Staff. While in contact with the substance, the character cannot benefit from a Short or Long
  Rest and all Healing sources will Heal only 1 point. The character will feel twitchy, nauseous, headachy,
  or paranoid (or any combination of these) while touching the material in question and should role play as such.
  Cloth will not stop these symptoms, but leather or thicker substances will. 2 points are awarded for
  materials that are likely to be very common such as leather, iron, and materia. 1 point is awarded for
  materials that are less likely to be common or a hindrance, such as gold, silver, or any of the Resources.
  No points will be awarded for materials that are unlikely to be encountered, or will rarely cause a hindrance
  such as dragonâ€™s eggs, glacial ice, or alchemical fire.
