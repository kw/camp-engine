name: Binding Oath of Honor
award: 2
description: >
  At some time in the past, the character made a binding oath of honor.
  The reasons for this oath, and for its powerfully magical binding, are up to the player.
  The character is required to obey the strictures as best as they can, and should the player
  realize that the character has broken the rules, she will lose access to her highest level
  Powers and will take a 1 point penalty to her maximum Life Point total. These will last
  until the character feels she has atoned for her failures in-game. Binding Oaths that are
  imposed by Staff require Staff approval for atonement.

  The Oath of Honor is as follows:

  * You will never break your word.
  * You will never cheat in any contest, nor use deception or trickery to win.
  * You will never attack those who are unaware, from behind, nor take unfair advantage.
