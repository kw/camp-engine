name: Binding Oath of Civility
award: 2
description: >
  At some time in the past, the character made a binding oath of civility.
  The reasons for this oath, and for its powerfully magical binding, are up to the player.
  The character is required to obey the strictures as best as they can, and should the player
  realize that the character has broken the rules, she will lose access to her highest level
  Powers and will take a 1 point penalty to her maximum Life Point total. These will last until
  the character feels she has atoned for her failures in-game. Binding Oaths that are imposed
  by Staff require Staff approval for atonement.

  The Oath of Civility is as follows:

  * You will never speak ill of others.
  * You will not let it slide when such things are said of others.
  * You will show all living creatures respect and politeness.
