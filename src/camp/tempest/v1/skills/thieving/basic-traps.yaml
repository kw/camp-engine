name: Basic Traps
cost: 5
description: >
  This skill allows a character to attempt to disarm traps.
  See the Traps and Locks chapter for details.
  Without this skill any attempt to manipulate a triggered trap, including moving it,
  cutting wires, or anything else (other than simply avoiding it) will set the trap off,
  even if the trigger is not activated. The character with this skill may use props at
  hand, tools, or in-game items to stop the trap from going off. If the trap does go off,
  making its noise or performing whatever action indicates that it has been sprung, then
  the trap has gone off normally. There is no default prohibition about what can be done
  to the trap (i.e. wires can be cut, mechanisms jammed, etc.). A character with the Basic
  Traps will also automatically disarm latch traps by opening the protected object
  (lock, chest, etc.) but must rip up the Latch Trap card after disarming it
  (unless they have the Advanced Traps).
