description: >
  This skill allows a character three specific benefits. First, when disarming a Triggered Trap,
  they may keep the trap card if they disarm the Trap successfully. Secondly, if they disarm a
  Latch Trap they may keep the Latch Card to use again. Third, characters that have unused Latch
  or Trigger traps may set them as described in the Traps and Locks chapter. The exact details of
  the set trap must be noted with the trap itself, and the original description card of the trap
  mechanism must be included.
