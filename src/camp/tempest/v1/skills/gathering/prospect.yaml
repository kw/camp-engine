description: >
  The character can prospect for Rare Minerals or metal Ingots from the wilderness.
  Characters may discover mines that can be used to prospect for Ingots, or deposits where Rare Minerals can be collected.

  At either a mine or a deposit, the character should read the information card (and only characters with this skill can
  read the information card) at each location for specific information. By default, the character actively roleplays for
  a Slow 300 in order to gain anything from it. Roleplaying can be sorting through rock chunks, chipping away at the mine
  using tools, or anything to simulate the collection of resources. Multiple characters can use the mine or deposit at the
  same time. After the required duration, the character will follow the instructions on the information card, which will
  normally be to randomly choose a resource card which will grant between 0 and 3 Ingots or Minerals. Additionally,
  Mithril Ore will only be obtainable by characters with rank 3 Prospecting. Some of these cards may indicate something
  bad happening to the character like a rockslide or inhaling poisonous fumes. In these cases the effect will also be
  written on the card. The character may prospect at each mine or deposit once per Long Rest.

  Example: _Roger finds two deposits, and knows the location of three mines. After a Long Rest, he makes a circuit,
  stopping at the deposits and mines, spending five minutes at each, to prospect. At each one he receives a number of
  metal Ingots (mine) or Minerals (deposit). He canâ€™t get anything more from any of those five locations until after the
  next Long Rest. After the Long Rest, he then can prospect again at each location._
