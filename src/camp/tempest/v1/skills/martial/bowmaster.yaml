description: >
  When the character spends a Quick 10 aiming with a weapon in which she has Weapon Specialization, she may choose to do one of the following:

  * One additional point of damage.
  * Expend a Spike to deliver a Shield-Breaking Effect. This is called as “Shield Breaking”.
  * Expend a Spike to deliver a Disable Effect. This is called as “Disable [Limb]” where the
    limb called must be the one struck by the projectile. In the case of held objects, the limb
    holding the object must be called. Torso hits will allow the character to call any limb she wishes.
