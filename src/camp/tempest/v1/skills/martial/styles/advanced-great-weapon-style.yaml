name: Advanced Great Weapon Style
cost: 3
requires: great-weapons
description: >
  The character has trained significantly with great weapons and can hold a second weapon
  in the same hand as a great weapon without impeding the effectiveness of the great weapon.
  For example, a character could hold a polearm and one hand could also hold a short sword,
  and the polearm would still be usable and would be able to do Spikes, do Shield-Breaking
  damage, etc. if both hands are on the polearm. Note that although the effectiveness of
  the great weapon is unaffected, the second weapon cannot be used to do damage or block
  attacks if it is held in the same hand as the great weapon.
