description: >
  Once per Long Rest, the character can focus for a Quick 100 to infuse herself with elemental energy.
  The element she can attune to is determined when the Perk is taken and must be chosen from Flame,
  Ice, Lightning, or Acid. The attunement only lasts until the end of the next Short Rest. While attuned,
  the character may resist a number of elemental effects of their chosen element equal to their Life
  Point Maximum per Event. In addition, they are able to alter the Accent of any elemental power she uses
  to the chosen accent. However, they are unable to use powers with the opposition Accent.

  She also becomes vulnerable to the opposite element, and takes Effects from that element as Final.
  Flame and Ice are opposites, as are Lightning is the opposite of Acid. This Perk can be taken up to
  twice, and each time the character may choose any element they desire, although she may not to attune
  to more than one element at a time.
