name: Mystic Armorer
cost: 4
description: >
  The character was born with a special ability to create summoned armors.
  For every 2 points of summoned armor that the character creates with a Power
  (including Spells), the armor has one additional point. For example, if a 2
  point armoring Power were used (such as Mage Armor), it would make 3 points of Armor.
  Note that this has no effect on Powers that add to existing armor.
