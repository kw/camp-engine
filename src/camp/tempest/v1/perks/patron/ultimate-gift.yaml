description: >
  Once, the character can call out a final prayer to her Patron to save those around her.
  She should call out “[Patron’s name], I give the Ultimate Gift!”. She can now use three
  separate powers, at her discretion. She can call out “By My Voice Grant Life to [Names]”
  and give the names of any number of individuals, bringing them all back to life. She may
  call “By My Voice Heal 10 to [Names]” and heal all the named characters. She may also call
  out “By My Voice Short Grant _insubstantial_ to [Names]” When these things are complete,
  the character herself will die, immediately dissipate, taking Spirit form and heading for
  the Spirit Well. She will not return from the Well. This is a permanent and unavoidable
  death for that character. The character need not give a list of names and may just affect
  everyone within range.
