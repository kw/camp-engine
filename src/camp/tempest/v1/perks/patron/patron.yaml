description: >
  The character is under the patronage of a powerful supernatural creature.
  This may be a Fae Lady, a god or goddess, a Great Power, an elder demon, or any
  other creature of significant mystical strength. The character has some sort of
  relationship with her Patron, whether it be servile, romantic, or purely business.
  The character can never refuse a request by that patron without losing this Perk.
  The character has a relationship with this patron and can make requests or prayers
  to it, although there is no necessity that they be answered or honored. Most other
  Perks can be purchased more cheaply if they are granted (and thus revocable) by the Patron.
  Any Perk that doesnâ€™t have the Patron prerequisite that is going to be considered a
  gift from the Patron costs 1 CP less (to a minimum of 1).
