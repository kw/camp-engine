  You have a friend or ally who knows things. Choose two areas of Lore that your Contact
  has expertise in. Once per Event, you can write a note or letter to this contact and
  include a few Wealth and Staff will answer for your Contact with clues, information, or
  additional hints. The helpfulness of this information will depend on whether the questions
  match the Contactâ€™s Lore skills as well as the bribe sent. The player should create a name
  and simple backstory for the Contact and why that Contact would answer questions.
