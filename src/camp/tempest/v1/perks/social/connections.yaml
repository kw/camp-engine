description: >
  Itâ€™s all about who you know. The character may be a distant scion of a powerful family, or
  may have a past that has left others wanting to help her out. Characters with this Perk have
  friends in high places. This friendship will generally not extend to actual physical aid, but
  can help with Between Game Events, can help get letters of support or pardon, or any similar
  activity that does not cost those performing the favors too much. The actual details of these
  connections should be detailed in a note to Staff or in the character background.
