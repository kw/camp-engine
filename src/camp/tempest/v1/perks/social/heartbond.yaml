description: >
  Whether it is romantic love, familial love, an oath, or even a curse, there are some who are
  simply bound to help and protect each other. Please remember that these kinds of relationships
  must abide by the rules for romantic roleplay consent. When the Perk is purchased, the player
  should choose one other character with whom her character has the Heartbond. Note that this Perk
  does NOT require another character to take the same Perk. With chosen character, the character
  gets certain benefits:

  * The character has the benefits of the Perk Generous Soul, but only for the Heartbonded character.
  * While using Healing of any kind on the other Hearthbonded, the character may sacrifice any number
    of Life Points (but not more than her current total) and add those points to the Healing.
  * If the character is Berserked or Charmed and finds herself in the position of having to harm the
    Heartbonded individual, the duration of the Berserk or Charm ends immediately. If the Berserk or
    Charm does not _require_ that the Heartbonded character be attacked, she can simply be skipped.
    (i.e. if Berserked, if there are other individuals that could be attacked, the _next_ closest
    character will be attacked.)
  * The characters can feel each other's love as an almost physical sensation. At-will they may ask
    of the Heartbonded other: “_Divine: Do you love me?_”
