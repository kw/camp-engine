name: Othersleep
cost: 1
requires: -unwardable
description: >
  The character does not sleep on the prime plane. When she slumbers (true deep sleep,
  not normally napping) the character fades out the world, disappearing from this plane.
  Her equipment and clothing all stays, but she is gone until the morning comes.

  OOG: the player should have a white halo with a start time and end time written on it
  and this should be posted in clear sight near her sleeping space; this time cannot be
  longer than 10 hours, nor less than 2 and is meant to protect sleep; if it appears it
  is being used defensively, or to protect from normal attacks, Staff may remove the Perk.

  During the time on the sheet, the character is not present and cannot be affected, harmed,
  killed, etc., although her equipment is not protected. NPCs will not bother the PC, and
  although combat may occur around her, effort will be taken not to specifically disturb the
  protected character and player. When the time written on the sheet arrives, the character
  will reappear in the same location. There is no way for her to come out early, even if
  others need help. She should remain out-of-game and non-interactive while she is in Othersleep.
  This will recharge each sunrise. Cannot take Unwardable Flaw.
