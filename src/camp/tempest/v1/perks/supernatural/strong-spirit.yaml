description: >
  Normally, when a character gains the Spirit Type, she is incapable of looking at
  others or communicating. A character with a strong spirit can make eye contact and
  even make gestures (although charades-type communication is simply too difficult).
  In addition, she need not head directly to the Spirit Well, but can go to one familiar
  location or person first and can remain in that spot for up to ten minutes (Slow 600)
  before heading to the Well.
