  The character has some ability to contact the spirits of the departed.
  Not only can the Medium talk to Spirits in a few, limited ways, but with preparation
  (and a forewarning to Staff) can hold a rite that will summon a Spirit or two from
  individuals who are gone (who have permanently died).

  At-will, the Medium can ask any of the following questions of any Spirits.
  “[Name or Description] Discern to Spirit: What was your name?”, “[Name or Description]
  Discern to Spirit: How did you die?”, or “[Name or Description] Discern to Spirit: What
  do you need?” For the rite, she should have a table with accouterments on it that are
  meaningful to her for speaking to the dead. For each Spirit that shows up (which is at
  Staff discretion) the Medium must sacrifice 6 Life Points. If others are involved in the
  rite, and within Touch range, this number may be shared (equally, round down to a minimum
  of 1). This is the power the Spirit needs to take form and answer questions.

  The Medium should specify (also forewarning the Staff) the names of particular Spirits she
  is calling, or what kind of Spirits she is calling to. She can then ask each Spirit up to
  one question per character level. These will all have a call of “Discern to Spirit:” unless
  it has been agreed with Staff that the Call is understood. These questions may be anything,
  but the answers may be vague, incomplete, in the form of riddles or puzzles, or even incorrect.
  The answers will never be lies, however, and will be true to the best knowledge of the
  summoned Spirit.

  The Medium can summon as many Spirits as she likes (sequentially) in a session, but too many
  may cause the Spirits to get angry, with unpredictable results. The Medium can only perform such
  a rite once per Event.
