name: Soothsayer
cost: 3
description: >
  A soothsayer can see into the future, or see through the thin veil between reality
  and the possible. By performing a small ceremony (which may be drawing cards, viewing
  entrails, or even preparing for a sleep filled with prophetic dreams), the character
  should provide a question or topic to Staff in written form and, sometime after the
  ceremony is performed, the answer will come to her in a vision or by some other sign.
  The character can request one vision per Long Rest.
