  The character can perform an easy rite, taking only a few seconds, which will sanctify a particular room.
  The character should pick a special item like a horseshoe, banner, or other significant, meaningful item,
  and place it inside the room to designate it as a Hearth. If the item is removed from the room for any
  reason, the Hearth Perks are lost until it is returned. Otherwise a new rite can be performed after the
  next Long Rest on a new item. The character can only perform a new rite on a new item once per Event.

  The room becomes the characterâ€™s Hearth and she can develop certain powers that are only effective when
  in her Hearth by taking additional Hearth Perks. In order for a room to become a Hearth, it must be the
  room the character intends to sleep the next time she sleeps. In addition, the room cannot be a public or
  multi-use room such as a Tavern. If the room is normally public but is closed off for sleeping, that is
  acceptable (such as a small shop that is closed and used as living quarters). While performing the rite,
  the character can name five additional people who also intend to sleep in that room and the area will
  count as a Hearth for them as well. Those others count this as their Hearth and can purchase and use other
  Hearth Perks even if they have no ability to make the Hearth in the first place.
