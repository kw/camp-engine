  When the character creates a Hearth, she may spend an additional minute or so on the rite,
  drawing in the magical weave to create a nexus of arcane energy. The Hearth will act as an
  Arcane Locus for the purposes of magical study until the end of the Event. The Hearth cannot
  also be designated as a Consecrated Hearth.
