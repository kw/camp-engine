name: Binding Oath of Charity
award: 5
description: >
  At some time in the past, the character made a binding oath of charity.
  The reasons for this oath, and for its powerfully magical binding, are up to the player.
  The character is required to obey the strictures as best as they can, and should the player
  realize that the character has broken the rules, she will lose access to her highest level
  Powers and will take a 1 point penalty to her maximum Life Point total. These will last until
  the character feels she has atoned for her failures in-game. Binding Oaths that are imposed
  by Staff require Staff approval for atonement.

  The Oath of Charity is as follows:

  * You will be charitable, keeping only the minimum arms and armor needed to do good deeds, and enough wealth for austere survival. All else will be given to those less fortunate.
  * You will give your time and your blood for the protection of those who cannot protect themselves as well.
  * You will be the champion of the poor and the oppressed.
