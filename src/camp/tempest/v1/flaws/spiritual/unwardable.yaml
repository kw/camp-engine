description: >
  Whether it is due to a curse, a bloodline corrupted by dark powers, or some more mysterious magic,
  the character cannot be at ease inside a Ward spell or a Haven Ritual. While the character is inside
  an area protected by a Ward spell or Haven Ritual, she is inherently drained and cannot benefit from
  Hearth-granted benefits, Long or Short Rests. In fact, if the character spends more than two
  contiguous hours inside a Haven-protected building, she will lose her ability to recharge spell-slots,
  Powers, etc. at the next Long Rest. The character cannot take Othersleep Perk.
