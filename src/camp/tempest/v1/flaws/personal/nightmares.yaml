name: Nightmares
award: 3
description: >
  The character is prone to awful nightmares. If she experiences anything terrifying to the character
  (in the judgment of the player), or is affected (un-Countered and un-Resisted) by any Powers with the
  Fear or Terror Accent, she will suffer awful repercussions after her next Long Rest. She will take a
  -1 penalty to her Spike damage (minimum 0) and number of Spikes (minimum 0), and in addition, will
  lose access to one spell-slot from each tier that she has access to. These penalties will last until
  the end of her next Long Rest after they are applied.
