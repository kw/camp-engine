"""Record models, specifically for player, character, and award records.

These models represent the mechanical records associated with a player,
namely their event (and other) award histories and how those awards are
divvied up to characters.

As with the `campaign` module next door, these models are are just for the
award calculation system. Actual player and character information is stored
in other models, and the app will use the values derived from these
models to populate the CharacterMetadata in the character sheet model.

For more details, see:

    Additionally, bonus CP, purchased SP, and role/class flags can be set here.

    Attributes:
      date: The date this award is associated with. Not necessarily the date someone
        literally pushed a button to award it.
      source_id: An identifier indicating an object in an external data model associated
        with this award. The specific type of source may depend on the category (below).
        This may be used in cases where, for example, the award for a specific event needs
        to be revised, which first requires removing the previous award data.
      category: The type of inciting incident associated with this award. For example, the standard
        XP/CP awards for an event (whether you PC or NPC it) have the EVENT category, with
        the event's ID as the source_id. If you also took an NPC Shift and received some reward
        because of it, that would have the NPC_SHIFT category, and the source_id would also be
        the same event.
      description: Descriptive text noting where/who the award came from for display purposes.
      character: If the award relates to a character, an identifier should appear here.
      event_xp: The amount of an event's XP award to assign. The player may gain more or less
        or none of this XP than this due to being ahead of or behind the Campaign Max XP at
        the time of the award.
      event_cp: The amount of Event CP to award to the character associated with this award.
        The character may not actually gain any CP if they're already at their limit for both
        Event CP and Bonus CP.
      bonus_cp: Amount of Bonus CP to award. The awarder should not manually move Event CP here,
        that will be handled automatically if needed. The character may not actually receive any
        Bonus CP if they're already at their limit for the season.
      background_approved: This award marks the character as having an approved background. Even
        if the character receives more than one of these (from separate chapters, say) they still
        only get the credit once.
      event_played: If true, increases the character's "events played" counter. Normally only true
        on PC event awards. Certain rules interact with this: you can freely rewrite your character
        until a character's second game, certain flags may allow specific changes until the played
        counter ticks, and the undo stack can't cross a played events boundary.
      event_staffed: If true, increases the player's "events staffed" counter. Normally true for
        an event where the player registers as full-time NPC/Staff.
      player_flags: Arbitrary flags to add to the player. For use in role/class/art access.
      character_flags: Arbitrary flags to add to the character. For use in role/class/art access.
      character_grants: Arbitrary grant strings, like "lore#Nature" or "divine-favor:3" or "lp:2",
        in case plot wants to arbitrarily add or subtract things to or from a character card.
