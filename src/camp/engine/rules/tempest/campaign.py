"""Campaign models.

These models calculate specific campaign-wide values based on event history.
Specifically, the cadence of game events controls the rate at which the
Campaign Max XP, CP, and Bonus CP levels rise over the course of the campaign.

Note that these models largely only contain enough data to perform calculations with.
The web app's models in camp.game.models will contain the "real" campaign/event info,
and will be responsible for creating, populating, persisting, and regenerating these
lower-level models as necessary.

For more details, see:
